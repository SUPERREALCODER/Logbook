🧭 Who I Am
Hi, I’m Deba — also known as SRC in the worlds of code.
Short for Superrealcoder, it began as a username, but it stuck —
a quiet reminder to create things that are real, yet a little beyond.

An Inspired Explorer, I navigate between the logic of machines and the mystery of meaning —
coding realities and charting ideas that might just matter.

I believe in building what feels true, playful, and sometimes even a little wild —
things that help, express, surprise, or simply spark curiosity.

🚀 What Drives Me
I explore the edges where technology, sustainability, and curiosity intersect.
From building full-stack web platforms, crafting IoT systems, developing visual novels, and writing research papers — to training in PV systems, working on electric bikes, or designing navigation visors for riders — I treat every project like an expedition.

I’ve tried building startups — some stalled, some sparked, and all shaped me.
Now, I build with intention: what I create should help someone, somewhere, even quietly.

🔎 What I Care About
Designing with thought.

Solving with joy.

Staying curious.

Trusting the process — and the people in it.

Following inspiration (often from my mother, nature, or books).

🎒 You’ll Find Me…
Writing or editing code with a sense of play

Making interfaces that feel something

Talking about sustainability, quantum tech, or space

Recording raw vlogs under “Walk with Deba”

Building towards something real, not perfect

🧠 A Line I Hold Close
“To explore and create something that’s true and fun — that’s when it blossoms.”
